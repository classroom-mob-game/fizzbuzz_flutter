# FizzBuzz in Flutter/Dart

This is a template project for approaching the FizzBuzz problem using Test-Driven Development
through [_The Classroom Mob Programming Game_](https://doctor-g.github.io/classroom_mob/).

This template is based on the default Flutter project, whose [lib/main.dart] and 
[test/widget_test.dart] files have been left in place. Instructors who want to focus on Dart
and avoid the distractions of a Flutter UI may wish to remove them.

## Problem Statement

Print the integers 1 through 100 each on their own line, except that  
if the number is divisible by 3, print &ldquo;Fizz&rdquo; instead,
if the number is divisible by 5, print &ldquo;Buzz&rdquo; instead,
and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print &ldquo;FizzBuzz&rdquo; instead.
