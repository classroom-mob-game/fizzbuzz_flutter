# FizzBuzz in Flutter/Dart

This is a template project for approaching the FizzBuzz problem using Test-Driven Development
through [_The Classroom Mob Programming Game_](https://classroom-mob-game.github.io/).

This template is based on the default Flutter project, whose [lib/main.dart] and 
[test/widget_test.dart] files have been left in place. Instructors who want to focus on Dart
and avoid the distractions of a Flutter UI may wish to remove them.

## Problem Statement

Print the integers 1 through 100 each on their own line, except that  
if the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead,
if the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead,
and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead.
