# FizzBuzz in Flutter/Dart

This is a template project for approaching the FizzBuzz problem using Test-Driven Development
through [_The Classroom Mob Programming Game_](https://classroom-mob-game.github.io/).

## Problem Statement

Print the integers 1 through 100 each on their own line, except that  
if the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead,
if the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead,
and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead.
