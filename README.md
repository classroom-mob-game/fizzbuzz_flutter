# FizzBuzz in Flutter/Dart

This is a template project for approaching the FizzBuzz problem using Test-Driven Development
through [_The Classroom Mob Programming Game_](https://classroom-mob-game.github.io/).

## Android Studio Configuration

If you get a warning about needing to configure the Dart SDK, and you have previously 
configured Flutter, then all you need to do is point Android Studio to your Flutter
installation. Under Settings, go to the Flutter tab, and make sure the Flutter SDK
path is properly set. The Flutter SDK includes the Dart SDK, so this should fix the
problem.

## Problem Statement

Print the integers 1 through 100 each on their own line, except that  
if the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead,
if the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead,
and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead.
